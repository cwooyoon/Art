  - Cecily Brown (born 1969[1]) is a British painter. Her style displays the influence of a variety of painters, from Francisco de Goya, Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon[2] and Joan Mitchell, to Old Masters like Rubens and Poussin, yet her works also present a distinctly female viewpoint.[3][4] Brown lives and works in New York City.[5][6]
