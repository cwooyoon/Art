Sweden's most famous etcher, Anders Zorn was a temperamental artist who found solace, after much wandering, near Lake Siljan in Sweden. Nude bathers were a favorite theme; it is said that he "defused the female nude for a generation of Victorian gentlemen." He often tapped local peasant girls to model for him and posed them on the sunlit islands fringing Stockholm. In his hurried handling of the etching needle, Zorn owes a debt to Rembrandt (he owned about 200 Rembrandt prints). In his use of light he resembles the Impressionists, many of whom he had met in Paris.
