## This waterfall is called Honokohau Falls and it is located in the West Maui Mountains in Hawaii.

The falls drop from atop the mountains into a pool halfway down the cliff face. The water spills from a small pool and plunges another several hundred feet to another pool at the bottom of the mountain. The total drop of this waterfall is 1,119 feet! The only way to view the waterfall is by helicopter since the area where it is located is in an inaccessible section of the valley.
